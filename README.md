Unsupervised Context-Based Similarity Learning for Music Recommendation

The mathematical nature of music, that is each song can be characterized by some vectors, has been widely used for music recommendation systems. However, the social nature of music has comparatively received less attention. There are some patterns from the music listening context of various users can be learned to construct the relationship graph of music. In other word, based on enough data, the characteristics information within thousands of millions pieces of music can be exposed by peopleâ€™s behaviors during listening to music. This paper proposed an approach based on the music listening sequence collected from social music networks, like Last.fm, to predict interesting songs for the user. This method can be implemented without any knowledge about the music itself.
